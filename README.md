Astro answers is a simple web app that uses [D3 Celestial](https://github.com/ofrohn/d3-celestial) to render the actual 
star map and constellations according to your location. 
If you set your zodiac sign it gives an AI-generated small horoscope for the day.
You can ask ANY question in the input field and get the answer by the wise all-knowing universe (OpenAI).
